# cluster-lab

this is a repo for my testing system/cluster management using systemd for everything

first run `./build.sh` to build containers and `./install.sh` to install systemd services

run `./test.sh` to bring up the cluster, and open firefox with cockpit and dask dashboards

submit python tasks to dask:
```
#TODO
```

in a real world deployment, cluster/* would be some terraform instead
